## Why AFO?

Your Downloads folder is a crime scene. Screenshots next to invoices next to
that PDF you needed six months ago. AFO watches, sorts, renames, and
de-duplicates your files automatically — with a visual rule builder for when
"automatically" needs a little steering, and full undo for when it doesn't
go your way.

<br/>

## Features

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Organize
- **Smart Sort** — by extension, date, or metadata, one click
- **Batch Rename** — pattern templates with live preview
- **Visual Rule Builder** — drag-and-drop conditions on a React Flow canvas
- **Metadata-Aware** — reads EXIF (camera, GPS) and audio tags (artist, album)

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Automate & Protect
- **Real-Time Watching** — organize as files land, per-directory opt-in
- **Scheduled Runs** — cron-based automation, 4 action types
- **Duplicate Detection** — blake3 hashing, quarantine before delete
- **Full Undo/Redo** — every operation is reversible, bulk or single

## Quick Start

```bash
# Linux (.deb)
sudo dpkg -i afo_3.0.3_amd64.deb

# Linux (.rpm)
sudo rpm -i afo-3.0.3.x86_64.rpm

# Windows
# Download AFO-3.0.3-setup.exe from Releases and run it
```

Open AFO → point it at a folder → hit **Scan** → review the preview → **Execute**.
Or just turn on **Real-Time Watching** and forget it exists.

<br/>
